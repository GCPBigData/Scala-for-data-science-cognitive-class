(0006.2001-02-08.kitchen.ham.txt,Subject california power 2  8 please contact kristin walsh   39510   robert johnston   39934  for further clarification . executive summary  utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles  agreement  payback for the bailout  rate increases  and further short  term funding for dwr purchases  power . disagreement persists between gov . davis and democrats  the legislature  how the state should  paid back for its bailout  the utilities . the split  over  stock warrant plan versus state ownership  utility transmission assets . the economics  the long  term contracts appear  show that rate hikes are unavoidable because  the need  amortize the undercollected rates  the utilities during the recent rate freeze period . air quality management district regulations are under review  but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity . legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left  wing consumer groups and are being forced   least slow   not stop  davis   bailout and rate hike plans . senator burton   eminent domain threats against generators  which reflect this pressure  are  little significance . 1 . bankruptcy outlook rising once again  deal  finalize  debt workout continues   just beyond the reach  the state  the utilities  and their creditors  with time running out  the debt forbearance arrangement set  expire  tuesday . socal edison and    are not paying any  their bills except for payroll . they are working very hard  keep cash   hand  and have indicated that they feel that they are very close   involuntary bankruptcy filing . once this filing occurs  they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing  the utilities file  voluntary bankruptcy . opinion within the assembly  divided with respect  the outlook for bankruptcy . assemblyman keeley told our source that  filing  likely  but that everything will  resolved during that 50  day period . senator john burton     hurry   reach  deal with the utilities    believes that the state  california    good position   strong  arm  the utilities . burton currently does not intend  cede  the utilities  that they can avoid bankruptcy . the senator stated   bankruptcy would  bad  but not the worst thing possible .   intends  stick  his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis  end    week deadline for striking  deal with the utilities . still  bankruptcy can  avoided   last  minute deal can  struck monday   what the state receives  return for the bailout the scope  rate hikes   federal court  expected  rule  the     socal  . cpuc rate undercollection case monday  additional financing  made available  the dwr  buy more power until the revenue bonds can  issued  may . there   possibility that significant progress  these issues could lead   further extension  creditor forbearance . however  the negative tone taken  standard  poors and others concerning delays  the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult  achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via  high  level washington summit which does not appear likely  happen this weekend . additional financing for dwr will not  automatically approved  the legislature . the non  energy expenditures  the california government are now  risk   there  not yet  rate structure  place  recover the costs being expended  power from the general fund . 2 . state  take 2  3  utility debt while the state seems  have succeeded  forcing the utility parents  eat close  one third  the  12 billion debt   final deal has been held   two fronts . first    still unclear what the state will get  return for the utility debt .   possible that there will   mix  stock warrants and   transmission assets .  takeover  the transmission assets seems more likely than  takeover  the hydro assets . the value  these assets still has not been settled . second  while the state will   the hook for  9 billion    not clear what mixture  rate hikes and revenue bonds will  used  recover the cost  the bailout . finally  expect davis and other california politicians  work  minimize rate hikes  although the edison      . cpuc case  monday  likely  force their hand here  and   everything possible  avoid the appearance   bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants .  price has been set  which the state would purchase the utilities  transmission assets  which are currently valued  approximately  7   8 billion . all  the proceeds though cannot  used  pay off the utilities  debts   some  the money would   existing bondholders . however  ipp sources advise that there  already  bid  the table for these transmission assets that  higher than what the state would offer . 3 . long  term contracts  noted  the governor  his announcement tuesday  only 500   the 5  000   power contracted for can come   line immediately . much  the remainder reportedly was contracted  long  term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some  this will come   line  approximately two years . assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that  has received   tablet from  high  from governor davis that there must not   rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power  not from internal sources  from the market  but through long  term contracts  7 . 39 cents  kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents  amortize socal edison   undercollection from the recent rate freeze period .  the number  slightly different for    .  this assumption  based   natural gas price   7 . 90  2001 and  5 . 15  2005  and  efficiency heating rate  10  000  12  000  2001 and 7  200  2005 . these numbers were quoted  industry sources  who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price  natural gas   9 . 00   9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley   number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate  but they felt that 7  200  2005 was very optimistic unless  enormous amount  new generation capacity comes  line . according  keeley   numbers and assuming the filed rate case  settled   7 billion rather than  12 billion   would take 5  6 years  amortize all  the utility undercollection .  settlement  this case will need   reached  that the state can figure out how much  charge for power  order  amortize the undercollection . however  since assemblyman keeley   numbers are unrealistic   rate increase will  necessary . 4 . air quality district exemptions there have been  few bills introduced  provide exemptions from aqmd  air quality management district  regulations    20    28    31  . also  republicans have been asking the governor  lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility  san jose that was denied  the local government . currently there   contemplation  loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow  dirtier  plants  come   line .
